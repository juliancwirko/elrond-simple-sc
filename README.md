### PiggyBank - MultiversX Smart Contract for learning purposes

The logic is quite simple:
1. You create a Piggy Bank where you define the lock time using Epoch Timestamp as the argument
2. You can send an amount of EGLD to the smart contract, and it will be locked till the configured date
3. You can then payout the amount, but only after the configured lock date

> **âš  Proper docs, updates, tests, and dapp are on the way! Stay tuned.**

While waiting for proper tutorials and docs, you can test it and play with it even now.

To interact with the PiggyBank Smart Contract, you would need to have:
- [wallet](https://devnet-wallet.multiversx.com)
- [mxpy](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-py/installing-mxpy/)
- PEM file derived from the seed phrase

You can get all with [VSCode MultiversX IDE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elrond.vscode-elrond-ide) 

To derive the wallet pem file, check the docs [Deriving the Wallet PEM file](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-py/deriving-the-wallet-pem-file/)

### Old dapp (it will be rewritten soon)
- https://elven-piggy-bank.netlify.app

### Start with contract build**

```
mxpy contract build
```

**Important** You would need some xEGLD on the devnet. You can use the faucet: [https://r3d4.fr/faucet](https://r3d4.fr/faucet). To get some xEGLD you can also use offcial Web Wallets (devnet/testnet) or there is also an option on official [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1045353153073258557/1049254556216872990).

To use testnet switch to `--chain="T"` and --proxy="https://testnet-gateway.multiversx.com".

### Example mxpy interaction commands
##### These commands should be run one folder up from the cloned 'multiversx-simple-sc' folder or you would need to adjust your --project path

**Deploy the contract:**

```
mxpy --verbose contract deploy --chain="D" --bytecode="./output/piggybank.wasm" --pem="../walletKey.pem" --gas-limit=80000000 --proxy="https://devnet-gateway.multiversx.com" --recall-nonce --send
```

Smart Contract deployment. You will need to do this once.
In the example, the project name is `multiversx-simple-sc`, and the PEM file is located in `../walletKey.pem`.

You can also use snippets. In the terminal run `. interactions/devnet.snippets.sh && deploy`.

**Create the Piggy:**
(here, with the working SC address example, change it, if you deployed yours, you should have one)

```
mxpy --verbose contract call erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqvqphdwsdtd6cnlt025kuu9hzjqhnexgu67es8lqc44 --chain="D" --pem="../walletKey.pem" --gas-limit=5000000 --function="createPiggy" --arguments 1655316103 --proxy="https://devnet-gateway.multiversx.com" --recall-nonce --send
```

As an argument for the `createPiggy` function, we will pass the timestamp for the lock time (it should be in the future, of course, use https://www.epochconverter.com/).

You can also use snippets. In the terminal run `. interactions/devnet.snippets.sh && createPiggy`.

**Add amount:**
(here, with the working SC address example, change it, if you deployed yours, you should have one)

```
mxpy --verbose contract call erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqvqphdwsdtd6cnlt025kuu9hzjqhnexgu67es8lqc44 --chain="D" --pem="../walletKey.pem" --gas-limit=5000000 --function="addAmount" --value=1000000000000000000 --proxy="https://devnet-gateway.multiversx.com" --recall-nonce --send
```

We are adding one xEGLD (denomination 18, this is why it is, in fact, 1000000000000000000).

You can also use snippets. In the terminal run `. interactions/devnet.snippets.sh && addAmount`.

**Payout:**
(here, with the working SC address example, change it, if you deployed yours, you should have one)

```
mxpy --verbose contract call erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqvqphdwsdtd6cnlt025kuu9hzjqhnexgu67es8lqc44 --chain="D" --pem="../walletKey.pem" --gas-limit=5000000 --function="payOut" --proxy="https://devnet-gateway.multiversx.com" --recall-nonce --send
```

It will check if you can withdraw. It will compare lock time and the current block timestamp. 

You can also use snippets. In the terminal run `. interactions/devnet.snippets.sh && payOut`.

**Upgrade the contract:**
(here, with the working SC address example, change it, if you deployed yours, you should have one)
 
```
mxpy --verbose contract upgrade erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqvqphdwsdtd6cnlt025kuu9hzjqhnexgu67es8lqc44 --chain="D" --bytecode="./output/piggybank.wasm" --pem="../walletKey.pem" --gas-limit=20000000 --proxy="https://devnet-gateway.multiversx.com" --recall-nonce --send
```

You can also use snippets. In the terminal run `. interactions/devnet.snippets.sh && upgrade`.

### Snippets

You will find interaction snippets in `interactions/snippets.sh`. It is convenient to use when working with VSCode and MultiversX SDK plugin.

After deploying the smart contract, you need to edit the `SC_ADDRESS`. Also, make sure that the relative path to your wallet PEM file is correct. You will need to set it in `USER_PEM`.

### Testing

You will find tests in `tests/piggybank_rust_test.rs`. To run a test, you can use click on the `Run Test` button from under the test name in VS Code or you can run it with `cargo test --test piggybank_rust_test`.
